# Demo plots

These plots are meant to run with the compiled version of nodeplotlib. You can run them
with the following commands:

```
node ./tools/demo/scatter.js
node ./tools/demo/candlestick.js
npx ts-node ./tools/demo/scatter.ts
```

For further demos you can have a look at the **dev-server** app. In the _/data_ folder
you'll find demos for several plot types.
